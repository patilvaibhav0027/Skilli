# Ugly Number

# An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are only 2, 3, and 5.
# Given an integer n, determine whether n is an ugly number.
# To check this, repeatedly divide n by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it is completely divisible by them. After removing all possible factors:
# If the remaining value is 1, then n is an ugly number. If the remaining value is greater than 1, then n has another prime factor and is not an ugly number. Any n <= 0 is not an ugly number.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 6 Output: true Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3 Example 2:
# Input: n = 1 Output: true Explanation: 1 has no prime factors. Example 3:
# Input: n = 14 Output: false Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
